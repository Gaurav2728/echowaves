The echowaves.com is a YACT -- Yet Another Collaboration Tool. Why one more? After all we already have http://meebo.com and http://campfire.com and many other like http://facebook.com and such. They all are great, but... non of them fits our needs 100%, and non of them is open-source.

If you'd like to contribute, perhaps start  by picking a task from the TODO list at:

=== INSTALL (localhost)
copy config/database.yml-sample to config/database.yml and modify to taste (see below for some hints on different platforms)
rake db:create
rake db:migrate

=== POST INSTALL
SignUp a user. Activate the user by copy-pasting the activation URL from the debug log into an address of your browser and hit enter. 

To actually get the actionmailer stuff sent, you'll need to change the SMTP settings in config/environment.rb
In that case, you'll probably want to comment out the (currently last) line in config/environments/development.rb that reads "config.action_mailer.raise_delivery_errors = false", so that actionmailer failures are more visible.

Specific advice for different platforms and setups
--------------------------------------------------
WINDOWS
-------
To use this with MySQL, you will probably need to uncomment the lines in the database.yml file that say "Host: 127.0.0.1".  The error when this isn't put in is *not* particularly helpful, so if you're having trouble, give it a try.

SQLITE3
-------
change the "adapter" lines to read "adapter: sqlite3"
make the database lines something like "database: db/development.sqlite3" and "database: db/test.sqlite3"
