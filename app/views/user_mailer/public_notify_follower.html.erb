You're auto following a newly created convo "<%= @convo_name %>"

because you are following user: @<%=@user.login%> 

You can turn off this type of email notifications in your profile: <a href="<%=edit_user_url(invitor)%>"> @<%=invitor.login%></a>

or you can unfollow @<%=@user.login%> if you want to stop auto following the @<%=@user.login%>'s convos.
