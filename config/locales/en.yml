      headline1: "EchoWaves.com is an opensource group chat social network written in RubyOnRails."
      headline2: 'The source code is hosted at: <a href="http://github.com/dmitryame/echowaves">http://github.com/dmitryame/echowaves</a>.'
      p1: "If you like to chat, or blog, or share status updates with friends, or... <br/> ...socialize -- EchoWaves is just for you. Some say EchoWaves is a YACT ( Yet Another Collaboration Tool ). Others will mention that it looks more like a YASN ( Yet Another Social Network ). What ever the case might be, EchoWaves is as feature rich as Facebook, as simple to use as Twitter, and as dynamic as Meebo. It's built around convos rather than users. Isn't it more natural for humans to socialize around convos. If you have any other ideas or suggestions feel free to talk about it in"
      p2: "-- it's free and anyone can join. Start your own convos, invite all your friends to join your convos, follow other convos that look interesting to you. Have fun!"
