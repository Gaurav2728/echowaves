RubyNode
========

RubyNode is a library that allows read only access to Ruby's internal NODE
structure. It can retrieve the node trees of methods and procs and it can use
Ruby's parser to parse Ruby source code strings to node trees.

It provides the class RubyNode, which wraps an internal NODE. Trees of RubyNode
instances can also be transformed into trees of arrays and hashes (similar to
s-expressions), which are easy to manipulate and work with.


Requirements
------------

RubyNode is tested with Ruby 1.8.4, 1.8.5 and 1.8.6, but it should also work
with other 1.8 versions. RubyNode worked (and still does work) with older Ruby
1.9 snapshots (possibly some node types are not fully supported), but it
currently does not work with the latest 1.9 snapshots and releases.


Installation
------------

RubyNode generates some of its C source code from Ruby's source code, because
the node types and other details differ between Ruby versions.

For the official releases of Ruby 1.8.4, 1.8.5 and 1.8.6 the needed source
files are included in the package. To compile RubyNode for any other Ruby
version, you will need that version's source tar ball extracted somewhere.

So, for Ruby 1.8.4, 1.8.5 and 1.8.6 just run (as root):

  gem install rubynode

Or if you do not use the gem:

  ruby setup.rb

That command will compile the C extension and install all files to their
default location (to customize the non-gem installation, please see "ruby
setup.rb --help")

For other Ruby versions you need to provide the (absolute) path to the source
directory for that Ruby version in the enviroment variable RUBY_SOURCE_DIR.
Example (as root):

  RUBY_SOURCE_DIR="/path/to/ruby_source" gem install rubynode

Or if you do not use the gem:

  RUBY_SOURCE_DIR="/path/to/ruby_source" ruby setup.rb
