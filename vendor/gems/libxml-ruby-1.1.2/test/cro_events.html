	<h1>Innovation in a Reduced Cost and Enhanced Efficiency Environment</h1>
	<p>With the increasing cost of doing business and budget constraints, clinical 
	professionals need to do more than ever before with less, while still increasing 
	productivity and maintaining quality. Sponsors are operating with fewer resources 
	and need to outsource more but must do so with less money. And with a high number 
	of product failures, available dollars for outsourcing are being threatened 
	– this being especially true in smaller companies. Due to the increase in outsourcing, 
	CROs and Labs have a surplus of business right now and rate structures and pricing 
	have risen because of this. To top it all off, ever-rising turnover for both 
	sponsors and providers causes increased time and cost to complete studies. Centerwatch 
	reports that 94% of projects run over either or both time and budget. How can 
	we do better? </p>
	<p>How can CROs and Sponsors collaborate to reduce non-value added activities 
	so that more and better resources can be directed to more important work?</p>
	<p>How is large pharma employing cost saving innovations internally as well 
	as externally e.g. Flexible staffing from CROs for monitoring , data management, 
	safety, off-shoring, etc</p>
	<p>How can suppliers be more proactive in creating new business models to reduce 
	costs and maintain quality? </p>
	<p>Forecasting outsourcing demand and matching capacity increases with demand 
	growth and managing that growth - better planning with more transparency allows 
	partners to more effectively forecast the outsourcing demand and its impact 
	on both parties</p>

	<h1>Defining and Managing Quality in Clinical Trials </h1>
	<p>Timelines to get drugs to market are being shortened, budgets are being decreased, 
	and quality expectations are increasing. Most of outsourcing focus is on time, 
	cost and scope but a major challenge is in the quality of the process and the 
	major deliverables. There is no doubt quality is front of mind with drug companies 
	and regulatory agencies alike. Though it must be conceded that many current 
	practices were reactively triggered in response to quality problems, the future 
	will require that quality management be more proactively and comprehensively 
	integrated into study planning and execution. Quality must be considered not 
	as something imposed upon us, but as something that helps us. But how does one 
	go about defining quality, changing the mindset, specifying quality standards 
	and managing a team to those standards? This session sets out to explore this 
	key question and others including: </p>
	<p>How can quality be defined and measured? </p>
	<p>How do we manage the apparent contradiction between increasing quality and 
	reducing cost? </p>
	<p>How can teams focus on quality while dealing with competing priorities on 
	multiple studies they are managing?</p>
	<p>What skills/characteristics are needed for team leaders and team members 
	(on both the Sponsor and Provider sides)?</p>
	<p>In a sourcing relationship who is primarily responsible for quality?</p>
	<p>How do partners work together to achieve quality goals?</p>

	<h1>Standardization: The Holy Grail? The 2009 Update</h1>
	<p>A major frustration across the industry is the different methodologies for 
	the operations, conduct and management of clinical trials, site recruitment 
	and management, communications and performance, audit readiness (site and sponsor), 
	clinical project management, and the use of metrics to manage studies and training 
	of CTM personnel. The problem runs even deeper for small companies with less 
	resources, infrastructure and tools. There is little to no consistency across 
	companies which in turn affect costs dictated by service providers as they must 
	work on different platforms. Can the pharma and CRO industries work together 
	to inspire a new level of standardization? This lively panel is in follow up 
	to last year's serious-minded out-of-the-box discussion on the formation of 
	standards.</p>

	<h1>Developing Efficiencies Using a Central Lab &amp; CRO Together</h1>
	<p>Pharmaceutical and biotech companies often independently select central lab 
	and CRO suppliers. Considering the cross-industry tradition of achieving efficiencies 
	in only two of the three project drivers, time – quality –cost, this session 
	will present a case study of efficiencies realized in all three drivers when 
	using a resource partner which provides both central lab and CRO services. Specifically 
	discussed will be the unique efficiencies provided to the pharma client by the 
	central lab and the CRO data vendor perform real-time date management via a 
	proprietary connection. In addition, this session will highlight how resource 
	partnerships are welcomed within a pharma company's support areas of finance

	<h1>Ensuring Quality at the Sponsor, Site and CRO Levels </h1>
	<p></p>
	<p>Achieving quality in a highly regulated and scrutinized industry where time,

	companies today. Choosing suppliers who deliver quality work, while following 
	FDA and GCP guidelines, SOPs and monitoring plans and training to ensure personnel 
	understand their responsibilities and are in compliance is at top of minds.

	<p>Large pharma companies are moving toward engagement on a strategic level 
	in the early design and feasibility work by brining partners in early. As many 
	are going into a new territory, whether geographic or therapeutic, with new 
	molecules, they want the CRO input that much sooner. Smaller and mid size companies 
	also want a more collaborative relationship with CROs because they don't have 
	the throughput to gain the experience the CROs have and while there are large 
	gaps in time between when they have to perform certain tasks, CROs are expected 
	to keep up with regulations, etc. In addition, small companies want participation

	<h1>Transforming Drug Development Outsourcing with a Virtual Model</h1>
	<p>Virtual companies essentially outsource every component of development. Historically, 
	virtual companies have been comprised of only a handful of individuals (e.g. 
	researchers who have come from larger companies) or venture capitalists. These 
	new companies are being formed by those who are recognizing that the big pharma 
	model is losing its sustainability, and so they move their ideas (brain trust) 
	outside of the big company to start their own initiative. Now the model is beginning 
	to move into a construct where there is a whole portfolio of products being 
	managed virtually. As the industry aspires to a lower cost basis for drug development, 
	CROs must find ways to accommodate this by having a real stake in the success 
	of the client with risk-sharing models of rising interest. </p>

	<h1>The Implications of Post-Marketing Requirements on the Future of Drug Development 
	Partnerships </h1>
	<p>Post-marketing requirements (PMRs) required by FDA and other regulatory authorities 
	are becoming more demanding and increasing in complexity. While the information 
	ascertained by PMRs is crucial to expanding safety and efficacy information 
	on the drug, they are not always adhered to. PRMs place a large burden on the 
	R&amp;D function already struggling to get new products launched and the cost of 
	these added trials are great. While traditional Phase IV trials are done primarily 
	for marketing purposes, FDA is now looking for signals in large scale studies 
	for adverse events in real world situations. The parameters are not relative 
	to Phase IV so companies can't use phase IV approach for PMRs. Instead, they 
	are conducted by the same groups who do the initial pre-registration work. What 
	is the best approach to get the work done effectively? Sponsors are looking 
	to CROs to provide solutions, but many are still presenting their Phase IV teams 
	for these demanding trials. What used to be the exception is increasingly becoming 
	the rule for new drug approvals and the FDA will now have the ability to impose 
	financial penalties on pharma companies who do not comply. This development 
	is critical to the Pharma/CRO relationship as the CRO must be on board with 
	the time commitments and deliverables.</p>
	<p>Managing post approval studies - what is the best approach with inherent 
	regulatory uncertainty?</p>
	<p>Learning to perform these studies efficiently as the cost of these programs 
	can exceed the cost of the drug registration program </p>
	<p>From a sourcing perspective, how do niche providers and CROs collectively 
	work on this to support the PMR effort?</p>
	<p>Europe and other countries are also requiring more post-approval commitments 
	– how are companies preparing?</p>

	<h1>Approaches to Address the Impact of Increasingly Complex Clinical Trials
	</h1>
	<p>Increasingly complex clinical trial protocols demand more of investigative 
	sites and study volunteers, leading to longer cycle times, more AEs and increasing 
	difficulty in recruiting and retaining patients, according to research by Tufts 
	CSDD. Combining the influx of less experienced investigators from emerging markets 
	and increasing churn among &#39;established&#39; investigators with not only an increase 
	in the number of trials but also an increase in their complexity opens up a 
	major grey zone for clinical trial quality. What are some of the pragmatic approaches 
	to overcome these challenges? This session explores the answers and sets the 
	stage for introducing a proactive approach to predict and prevent protocol violations, 
	both from a drug development service provider perspective, and from a site/investigator 
	perspective. Key clinical trial success factors to be discussed include:</p>
	<p>Successfully leveraging emerging market investigators who may be less experienced 
	for trials that are becoming more complex and demanding</p>
	<p>Architecting a site management plan that promotes primary data quality and 
	consistency yet allows flexibility based on country-specific differences</p>
	<p>Best practice for investigators to absorb a clinical trial into regular site 
	operations</p>

	a very candid understanding of business interests for both CROs and Sponsors. 
	When Sponsors and CROs do not share the same end goal (e.g. regulatory approval) 
	or the same risks how can their interests be aligned? Would pharma companies 
	be willing to put in significant incentives, monetary or otherwise, tied to

	<h1>Fulfilling Post-Marketing Requirements Utilizing Endpoint Trials</h1>
	<p>Post-Marketing Requirements are being imposed with greater frequency by the 
	FDA and other regulating agencies, in many cases, to obtain additional safety 
	data in a long-term or niche population. The more commercially-oriented Phase 
	IV studies of the past are no longer sufficient to fulfill the scientific rigor 
	required in the current regulatory environment. Endpoint point trials as a means 
	of fulfilling these obligations are becoming more common, allowing evaluation 
	of a treatment on mortality or major morbidity within a disease entity. There 
	are challenges associated with the implementation of endpoint trials which require 
	close collaboration to ensure the quality and consistency of the safety data 
	collected. In this session, the following points will be discussed:</p>
	<p>What are the advantages of utilizing an endpoint trial to fulfill post-marketing 
	commitments?</p>

	<h1>Adaptive Clinical Trials: Innovations in Trial Design and Management</h1>
	<p>With pharmaceutical companies facing the increasing challenge of diminishing 
	pipelines, drug developers are always looking for new methods to shave time 
	off of discovering and developing new molecules. Tools such as adaptive trial 
	designs allow clinicians the ability to "fail faster." This is accomplished 
	by utilizing accumulating data to direct potential modifications to the trial 
	as it progresses, while at the same time keeping the validity and integrity 
	of the study in tact. In addition to cost and time savings, adaptive trials

	<h1>Outsourcing Clinical Trials in Emerging Regions</h1>
	<h1>I. Outsourcing Clinical Trials in India and China</h1>
	<p>Off shoring clinical trials to emerging markets around the world is receiving 
	increasing attention as a very attractive alternative in the clinical development 
	process. Do clinical research capabilities comparable to the US in terms of 
	sophistication and FDA-compliance exist anywhere else in the world? And if they 
	do, are they ready to handle the marked increase in demand from the US? Our 
	panelists discuss in detail the demographics, challenges and opportunities, 
	expertise of individual countries and the opportunities to optimize project 
	budgets and reduce development time and regulations with global implications 
	including:</p>
	<p>How cost control and investor expectations is leading to increased off-shoring 
	opportunities</p>
	<p>Understanding regulatory and operating environment of emerging markets as 
	well as cultural intricacies and how</p>
	<p>to place and execute clinical trials there</p>
	<p>How to offshore a project in such a manner that the work is seamless to the 
	end user, i.e. the offshored partner performs the work in the same manner as 
	an internal colleague</p>

	<h1>The Functional Service Provider Model: Exploring the Challenges and Benefits</h1>
	<p>As sponsor companies continue to feel the effects of increased performance 
	pressures with flat or negative headcount growth, loss of exclusivity with fewer 
	revenue replacement prospects, tightened regulatory environs with increasing 
	scrutiny of obligations, and more intense cost containment demands, alternative 
	sourcing paradigms are becoming the norm and no longer the exception. Specifically, 
	the Functional Service Provider model of outsourcing has continued to grow in 
	primarily large biopharmaceutical companies; however, mid and even small companies 
	are looking toward the FSP model as a way to respond to the changing development 
	environment. This session will focus on functional approaches seen in practice 
	and in theory to present for discussion the value platform proposed by this 
	model. From highly transactional, commodity-like services to the value-add hybrid 
	approach, the panel will seek to engage the audience to debate the challenges 
	and benefits in the FSP paradigm.</p>

	<h1>Small BioPharma Partnerships: Challenges and Opportunities for Transactional 
	vs. Strategic Approaches</h1>
	<p>Small pharma and biotech companies tend to bring in partners very early to 
	discuss development and often gravitate to biggest most global CROs who can 
	run the entire study. Is this the best operational choice? Small company clinical 
	operations look to the project manager at the CRO to be their virtual internal 
	clinical leader but CROs are not all set up to engage in this way. Many small 
	companies do not have the pipeline to engage in strategic relationships, and 
	must be transactional, but how do those companies get attention from a large 
	CRO? The issues are the same as those at Big Pharma, but large companies have 
	different perspectives and engage CROs on multiple strategic levels (feasibility, 
	expertise). Who is the person at the supplier who will advocate to their senior 
	management for your organization when things go wrong? How have small and mid-size 
	pharma/biotech partnered for success as they have more to lose if a trial and/or 
	provider relationship does not go well due to poor planning, miscommunication, 
	etc? When strategic outsourcing/partnerships don't resonate with small companies, 
	sponsors and suppliers must have a meeting of the minds on the challenges that 
	small companies face on a tactical level. </p>
	<p>How emerging Biotechs have managed to stay top of mind when working with 
	a large CRO </p>
	<p>What are the benefits and challenges of working with a smaller CRO? Or multiple 
	CROs (e.g. network of small regional CROs rather than one large global one)?</p>
	<p>Is there any one right model or does it depend on what phase you're working 
	in?</p>
	<p>How does the CRO get the right team to its clients?</p>
	<p>How are CROs staffing their organizations to deliver to smaller companies?</p>

	<h1>How Do Mergers, Acquisitions and Licensing Impact Outsourcing Decisions 
	and the Role of the CRO?</h1>
	<p>With so many Big Pharmas working within M&amp;As and constantly changing portfolios, 
	mid-size companies no longer developing their own compounds but acquiring them 
	instead, and small companies seeking only enough drug registrations so that 
	another company can buy them out, there is a change in the business we need 
	to respond to which opens the door for thinking about sourcing differently. 
	The lack of history and emotional attachment which comes with acquired compounds 
	affords the opportunity for culture change. No matter what size company however, 
	for successful development, partners need to understand what the ultimate goal 
	is.</p>
	<p>What can Big Pharma learn from small companies?</p>
	<p>What is the role of the CRO is helping a sponsor develop a compound that 
	has been acquired or licensed?</p>
	<p>After the service provider is chosen, how do you build trust – when in the 
	process of selecting, how much info are companies willing to provide and share 
	so they can collectively make a good decision?</p>
	<p>How do IP and commercial implications factor in for more sophisticated portfolios 
	rather than simply a virtual company with one compound?</p>
	<p>In the case of M&amp;A, what happens to the Suppliers working with the company 
	being acquired? Does it affect their position/relationship with the company? 
	Does the company keep them informed about their status as the</p>
	<p>event progresses? Are they in a more secondary role?</p>
	<p>What if the M&amp;A is on the CRO side?</p>

	<h1>What Does FDA Expect Regarding Quality Oversight of Third Parties?</h1>
	<p>Outsourcing of clinical research activities is increasingly common in FDA-regulated 
	medical product development.</p>
	<p>Last year, Frost &amp; Sullivan calculated that drug and biotech companies spent 
	$57 billion on outsourcing; contract research organizations (CROs) got almost 
	30 percent, or $17 billion. U.S. companies in particular outsourced 40 percent 
	of their clinical trials and that's expected to rise to 65 percent by 2013. 
	As a result, FDA has seen the emergence of an alarming trend regarding the submission 
	of unreliable clinical research data to the agency. Therefore, FDA's medical 
	device center began analyzing this trend and found some common threads that 
	lead to these unwanted situations. This presentation will uncover some of those 
	warning signals and outline methods employed by industry to mitigate their occurrence.</p>

	<h1>Educating Procurement and Outsourcing: How a Better Domain Knowledge Makes 
	Your Job Easier and More Effective</h1>
	<p>Biomarkers is an innovative new tool that clinical operations and study management 
	teams are increasingly utilizing which afford them the ability to cut down on 
	costs and resources and make faster decisions within the overall drug development 
	programs for clinical trial endpoints and timelines. In many cases, however, 
	outsourcing/procurement professionals may not fully understand the use of such 
	procedures/services: 1) why they are necessary and being utilized within drug 
	development programs, 2) how the primary endpoints of a trial are enhanced by 
	their use, 3) what the Procedure/test/service/analysis actually is, and 4) the 
	variety of services that exist. As the first and sometimes only contact reaching 
	out to vendors, the education on the use of biomarkers and the impact they have 
	on the clinical trial progression and deliverables is crucial to having Sponsors 
	bulk up their knowledge of what's out there to better support their respective, 
	internal study management teams across all phases of trials. </p>

	<h1>Patient Recruitment: Understanding Internet Health Seekers and Why an Online 
	Strategy is Important</h1>
	<p>Over 90% of clinical trials miss deadlines. Slow enrollment continues to 
	be a leading cause of study delays. Slow enrollment costs sponsors hundreds 
	of thousands of additional dollars every day. There are many factors and trends 
	impacting clinical trial recruitment including niche product development, competing 
	studies and protocol complexity.</p>
	<p>To meet current and future enrollment needs, organizations need to expand 
	their strategies and reach out to a rapidly growing Internet health seeker audience. 
	Internet health searches are growing at three times the rate of the Internet. 
	More than 66% of users have searched online for health information and 33% search 
	monthly. It is also important to note that 25% visit the Internet prior to a 
	physician visit. Disease information along with alternative treatment options 
	are frequently researched topics. Through the use of actual survey data, this 
	presentation will enable individuals and organizations focusing on patient recruitment 
	to build effective Internet based recruitment programs.</p>

	<h1>Improving Outsourcing Effectiveness and Quality Through the Use of Data 
	Standards</h1>
	<p>Sponsors of clinical research sometimes do not achieve the benefits anticipated 
	from outsourcing because of many variations in processes from study to study. 
	The result is that sponsors spend a considerable amount of time trying to understand, 
	QC, reconcile and integrate supplier/CRO data. Data standards, while not a panacea, 
	can help address these issues. If data are exchanged/delivered via an industry 
	standard specification (e.g. the CDISC Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) or 
	LAB Model), costs to develop specifications for data exchange are lower, there 
	are few errors in specifications and less ambiguity as to what the biopharmaceutical 
	company wants their partner(s) to deliver. There also are fewer communication 
	breakdowns and hand-off delays, and it is easier to integrate data from a variety 
	of providers, including CROs, laboratories and EDC suppliers. In this presentation, 
	we will consider the benefits of standards to improving the effectiveness of 
	outsourcing by examining multiple different outsourcing scenarios or use cases 
	including (1) data exchange during various phases of clinical research between 
	a biopharmaceutical company and CRO(s); (2) laboratory data exchanged between 
	a biopharmaceutical company and an external central lab; and (3) data exchanged 
	between a biopharmaceutical company and an EDC supplier.</p>
	<p>Understand the role of data standards in improving the effectiveness, efficiency, 
	and quality of clinical research outsourcing</p>
	<p>Examine several scenarios or use cases that demonstrate how to best deploy 
	standards in support of outsourcing</p>
	<p>Review best practices on when and how to use clinical data standards for 
	help in establishing and communication expectations to an outsourcer in a structured 
	way at project start</p>
